# BiggerBoatMapExploreRadius for Valheim

This is a Bepinex mod for Valheim that increases the slope angle you can walk up without sliding.

## Contributors

Lucidinceptor for giving the icon mad drip

## Configuration

The sole configurable option is the SlidingThreshold:
- 38 degrees is the vanilla default.
- 50 degrees is the mod default. It is approximately the steepest angle athletic humans can scale without assistance, a harness, etc.
- 90 degrees does not turn you into spider-man and let you scale walls. It just disables the sliding feature entirely.
- 0 degrees should be used if you enjoy suffering.

## Installation (manual)

If you are installing this manually, do the following

1. Extract the archive into a folder. **Do not extract into the game folder.**
2. Move the contents of `plugins` folder into `<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\plugins`.
3. Run the game.
